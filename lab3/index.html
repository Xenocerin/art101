			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The lab was intended to flush out the local file structure on my computer and incorporate some new index.html files into it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The biggest issues I had weren't even related to the assignment but customizing smaller 
						aesthetic components to my liking without conflicting with the pre existing classes i.e. 
						trying getting a header to be a certain font only to find out it had been specified one in the site.css.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I felt it went well I feel like I have a thorough grasp of file structure and how to path to files within it. I also enjoyed messing around with the various style settings within the css.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Below you'll see an overveiw of the file structure from within VSC.</p>
