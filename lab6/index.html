			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays & Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to both make an array representative of our various methods of transportation
						& an object representative of our primary method of transportation.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>None really though I did have an annoying external issue with my console relating to third party cookies
						though that's been pretty much resolved.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall this was a nice way to practice with arrays and objects and I feel I have a deepened understanding of them both </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Below you can find both an array showing all my ways of getting around and an object representing my main ride
						all on the html page I made.
					</p>
