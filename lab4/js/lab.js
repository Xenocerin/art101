    //Starting with creating the largest ship, represented by Os, at center
        //Move location with arrow keys, change orientation with “r”
            //If any segment of ship would be off grid deny move
    //“Enter” to confirm then repeat until smallest ship
//Randomize computer boat locations]
		//Randomly place ships in descending order from largest to smallest
        //If any segment of ship would be off grid place again
//Print board after inputs
    //Print a row of ten Xs, Ms if misses, Hs if hits indent at end
        //Repeat until ten rows
//Accept user inputs

		//Place M or H on corresponding tile depending on if miss or hit
//Choose computer inputs
    //Place hit marker in center of spaces with width and height equal to largest      surviving enemy ship
			  //If no spaces meet dimensions decrease area by one width and one height but not less than 2                                           
//Test if win condition
	  //If player var shipsRemaining = 0 computer win
		    //If computer var shipsRemaining = 0 player win
