				//Take user boat locations
					//Starting with creating the largest ship, represented by Os, at center
						//Move location with arrow keys, change orientation with “r”
							//If any segment of ship would be off grid deny move
					//“Enter” to confirm then repeat until smallest ship
				//Randomize computer boat locations]
						//Randomly place ships in descending order from largest to smallest
						//If any segment of ship would be off grid place again
				//Print board after inputs
					//Print a row of ten Xs, Ms if misses, Hs if hits indent at end
						//Repeat until ten rows
				//Accept user inputs
					//Take user input in form of a letter and number i.e. “D1”                                             
						//Place M or H on corresponding tile depending on if miss or hit
				//Choose computer inputs
					//Place hit marker in center of spaces with width and height equal to largest surviving enemy ship

				<h2>Replacing a broken window:</h2><br>
				<ol>
					<li>Measure dimensions of window</li>
					<li>Strip away old trim and remove broken pane from frame</li>
					<li>Find a replacement window</li>
					<li>Place new pane in frame</li>
					<li>Seal with new trim</li>
					<li>Repaint over trim if necessary</li>

				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>Developing a cohesive blueprint for our game was difficult largely due to the sheer amount of small
					factors,
					even after all the time we spent ideating I'm sure we missed something</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>Our primary issue was developing an idea of how the computer would operate but thankfully I had some
					pretty solid battleship strategies from my dad that I used to plan out the AI. There was also the issue of us being unable to figure out how to move our pseudocode left without messing up the formatting.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>We definitely put alot of thought in ideation and even more effort in trying to problem solve to mixed results.</p>
