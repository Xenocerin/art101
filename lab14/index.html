			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to go back and correct any bugs in previous code, in my case that'd be my lab 9 toggle class button.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The issue was that despite me beleiving I properly connected the classes I was unable to toggle no the special class and couldn't figure out why.
						However given the number of labs and experience gained since then I was almost immediately able to diagnoise the problem as me being an idiot, turns out that
						since I'd made the original div and buttons classes both so similar I'd confused the div and button classes and plugged the div class into the ".click" method 
						meaning that the button was connected to nothing. Additionally despite making a class for my buttons I listed it as an id meaning even if I would've gottent the name correct intially it wouldn't have worked.
						Thankfully now having a little more experience the problem was easy to recgonize and address.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I've since realised to pay closer attention to syntax as a slight slip up can have you being forced to peer over lines of code for one spelling mistake.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here is the new code and and image of the working special class.
